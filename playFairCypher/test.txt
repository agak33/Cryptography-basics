Long, long ago, when people spoke languages quite different from our own,
many fine, big cities already existed in the sunny lands of the world. There
were towering palaces inhabited by kings and emperors; there were broad
streets, narrow alleyways and winding lanes; there were sumptuous
temples filled with idols of gold and marble; there were busy markets selling
wares from all over the world; and there were handsome, spacious squares
where people gathered to discuss the latest news and make speeches
or listen to them. Last but not least, there were theatres, or, more properly,
amphitheatres.
An amphitheater resembled a modern circus, except that it was built
entirely of stone. Seats for spectators were arranged in tiers, one above the
other, like steps lining the crater of a man made volcano. Many such
buildings were circular, others semicircular, others oval.
Some amphitheatres were as big as football stadiums, others could hold
no more than a few hundred people. Some were resplendent with columns
and statues, others plain and unadorned. Having no roofs, amphitheatres
were open to the sky. This was why, in the more luxurious ones, spectators
were shielded from the heat of the sun or from sudden downpours by goldembroidered awnings suspended above their seats. In simple
amphitheatres, mats woven of rushes or straw served the same purpose.
In short, people made their amphitheatres as simple or luxurious as they
could afford, just as long as they had one, for our ancestors were
enthusiastic playgoers.
Whenever they saw exciting or amusing incidents acted out on stage, they
felt as if these make believe happenings were more real, in some
mysterious way, than their own humdrum lives, and they loved to feast their
eyes and ears on this kind of reality.
